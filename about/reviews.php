                 Fanfare Magazine. Issue 41:6<br/>
                 Colin Clarke

                 <p class="quote-open">The solo cello piece Delphi—What the Oracle Said (1994, revised 2014) ruminates on glimpses of futures and the lingering effect of places on the soul—in this case, Delphi, visited by the composer while still a young teenager. Cellist Tanya Anisimova and Krash have been collaborators for over two decades. Anisimova, who also appeared on Krash's earlier disc on Albany, phrases expressively and really allows her instrument to speak. The resultant "narration," lasting over seven minutes, is absolutely gripping; the cello is recorded well, and blissfully not too closely.</p>

                 Voix-Des-Arts<br/>
                 Joseph Newsome

                 <p class="quote-open">It is fitting that the final piece on Past Made Present should be Delphi — What the Oracle Said, an affectionate reminiscence for solo cello of an adolescent visit to Greece. Like a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela for modern Catholics, a visit to Delphi was for denizens of ancient Hellenistic societies both an end, the culmination of an arduous journey, and a beginning, the start of a spiritual voyage guided by the oracle's wisdom—a dichotomy shared by Krash's music. In Anisimova's hands, the timbre of the cello is the voice of a primordial force that has not yet conquered worded speech, a siren call that needs no verbalization to be understood. Anisimova's virtuosity encompasses not only the technical wherewithal to play Krash's music with confidence but also the artistry to deliver this musical monologue with an actor's theatricality. With this music, the oracle speaks of the continuity resilience and renewal, qualities that define the cellist's playing.</p>

                 John Campbell

                 <p class="quote-open">Romanticism—Forever Young<br/>
                                       Tanya Anisimova, cello; Daria Scarano, piano<br/>
                                       First Presbyterian Church, Virginia Beach.</p>

                 <p>In a program that might have been titled "August Franchomme (1808-1884) and his friends," cellist Tanya Anisimova and pianist Daria Scarano played a beautiful recital in Virginia Beach. We heard music by Mendelssohn, Chopin and Franchomme.</p>
                 <p>To set the romantic mood, Ms. Scarano opened the evening with Franz Liszt's (1811-1886) Les Cloches de Genève (the Bells of Geneva) for solo piano from Années de Pèlerinage I. Suisse 9 (1848-1854). The quiet opening drew us in and was followed by accelerated tempos and a variety of colors that built in intensity, only to retreat to soft bell tones.</p>
                 <p>"Forever Young" refers to the fact that both Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847) and Fréderic Chopin (1810-1849) did not live to see forty. Franchomme, the leading French cellist of his day, formed a happy admiring friendship with Mendelssohn when he visited Paris in 1831 and was also a close friend of Chopin who rewrote his Opus 3 cello part for Franchomme.</p>
                 <p> Both Ms. Anisimova and Ms. Scarano attended the Moscow Central School of Music of the State Tchaikovsky Conservatory when young. Ms. Anisimova continued her studies at Boston University and Yale University. Ms. Scarano, at the age of eight, was chosen to give a special performance for the royal Romanov family in Moscow. At age fifteen she was admitted to the University of Maryland School of Music where she gained her bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees. Both are well-traveled, prize-winning freelance soloists who have built successful careers in chamber and orchestral music around the world. Both have been recorded and praised for their playing.</p>
                 <p>Late in his life, around 1845, Mendelssohn composed Song without Words. There are tears in the opening notes and the cello is the voice in this cantilena, lyrical melody. It was Franchomme who advanced the elegant, smooth, light French bow technique that we heard. The Mendelssohn Cello Sonata, No.2, Op. 58 in D major that followed was written by him for his brother Paul, a cellist. The opening surging, confident melody is underpinned by a pressing piano accompaniment. The piano then takes over and the cello accompanies, though as the piece unfolds, they are treated as equals. The whimsical piano tune in the second movement is quickly taken up by pizzicato cello. In the second theme the cello achieves deep songfulness before it turns gruff, though in the ending they play fragments of both melodies. The leisurely pacing of the third movement piano arpeggios come before the cello offers a soulful aria that achieves the sound of a bass voice with very low notes. The lengthy fourth movement finale begins with rousing energy. The instruments offer accelerating arduous runs creating a dazzling, mad romp.</p>
                  <p>After a brief intermission Ms. Anisimova returned to play Franchomme's Étude for solo cello in B minor that offered a Romantic filter of Bach-like constructions that had an emotional transparency. It was light-weight music, reminiscent of contemporary easy listening.</p>
                  <p>The last piece was dedicated to Franchomme by his close friend Fréderic Chopin. His Sonata Op. 65 in G minor (1845-46) for cello and piano was premiered in Paris (1847) to great acclaim in what was to be the last performance of Chopin's career. There is a balance of equal material for the cello and piano. The dramatic and long first movement has a rising and falling half-step cello motive that opens the lush second movement with its folksy scherzo and tarantella finale. The Largo, third movement declared a "jewel" by Ms. Anisimova has a beautifully flowing melody. The Finale Allegro has a surprising richness of low cello notes, fleet but with a certain sense of melancholy.</p>
                  <p>Chopin composed the cello part and then fitted the piano part to it. The results are uncharacteristic of his natural piano idiom because he was trying to follow a Germanic sonata form. The playing was inspired and the audience responded enthusiastically with a standing ovation.</p>
                  <p>The encore was an improvisation with a sustained sound that built into what could be characterized as Gypsy soul.</p>

                 <p class="quote-open">What she [Anisimova] does is on the verge of the impossible. Such a harmonious, an effortless synthesis of the past (the inner, the eternal) with the future (yet undiscovered cosmos), while bypassing the present. Such a masterful combination of instinct, uncompromising spirit, and intellect. Only a handful of artists are able to accomplish this.</p>

                 Rogelio Macias Sanchez

                 <p class="quote-open">At noon, on Saturday, 21st of November, we gathered in La Sala Ninos Cantores of Conservatorio de las Rosas to be present at one of the most anticipated concerts of the festival. It was offered by cellist Tanya Anisimova and pianist Alexander Pashkov. Both are Russian, but have left their country. The concert has fulfilled the expectations of warmth, beauty, emotionality, and masterful interpretations. It is indeed impossible to select my most favorite from the Sonata for Cello and Piano No.1, by Brahms, The Gypsy Airs, by Pablo de Sarasate, in Tanya's own transcription, or Abendlied (The Evening Song) by Schumann, which was offered as an encore. Tanya decided not to do an improvisation, which are stunning.</p>

                 <b class="title">A Thoughtful And Powerful Cello Recital At Strathmore</b>
                 The Washington Post, October 6, 2007<br/>
                 Daniel Ginsberg

                 <p class="quote-open">Tanya Anisimova, a gifted cellist from the former Soviet Union now living in the United States, has mostly plied her art in academic conservatories. In those nurturing confines, a refined musical intelligence and commanding technique has taken shape. On Thursday evening at the Mansion at Strathmore, the artist showed she deserves far more attention among wider audiences, giving an energizing and alluring recital.</p>
                 <p>The performance was exhilarating in the way that Anisimova's interpretations were invariably full of personality and character - - whether in the spectral harmonies of Cesar Franck, the lush themes of Rachmaninoff, or her own music that marries a sense of wild fancy and studied control. There was an intimate, soliloquy- like feel to Rachmaninoff's Sonata in G Minor. Her own "Icelandic Ballad" could have done without the gentle howls in the last measures, as the nicely crafted theme-and-variations already had a haunting, ancient sound without Anisimova's vocals.</p>
                 <p>The recital was alluring in the sheer loveliness of the sounds Anisimova struck up as she partnered wonderfully with pianist Lydia Frumkin, who always played warmly and sensitively. Anisimova's melancholic, honey-touched tone blossomed in the skillful cello rearrangement of Franck's Violin and Piano Sonata in A. The Rachmaninoff was pure poetry in the way it toggled among scampering rhythms, biting vehemence and graceful tenderness.</p>
                 <p> Listening to this exceptional musicmaking, one wondered whether Anisimova is the Simone Dinnerstein of the cello. Like the American pianist who recently gained fame for her highly idiomatic recording on the Telarc label of Bach's "Goldberg Variations," Anisimova emerges as a highly focused artist with lots of ideas and the dexterity to back them up.</p>

                 Culture, Issue No. 22 (7583)<br/>
                 Evgenia Krivitskaya

                 <p class="quote-open">The end of the concert season was graced by a short festival marking the 100th anniversary of the great Russian cellist, Svyatoslav Knushevitsky. Technically, his birthday falls on the end of this year, and the concerts were organized by the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, the Moscow Conservatory, and the radio program "Culture" (as part of the Fifth Studio series "Musical Rarities"). But something must have been in the air, to make our best cellists – N. Gutman, V. Simon, A. Knyazev, I. Gavrysh and others – think of this artist at this particular time. Hearing Knushevitsky play (for example, as part of the legendary trio with David Oystrakh and Lev Oborin he often played with), one cannot help but marvel at the noble, aristocratic beauty of his sound. What a pity that most of these magnificent recordings survive only on old vinyl records that have become rare collectors' items. I did recently come across a Rachmaninov cello sonata on CD, performed by Knushevitsky and Oborin; but the rights to the release had been bought up by the Japanese who now sell it to us at double the price.</p>
                 <p>Yet not even these unfestive thoughts could eclipse my impressions of one of these memorial concerts, organized by the Philharmonic Orchestra and by Igor Gavrysh, a student of Knushevitsky's, now a Professor at the Moscow Conservatory. He performed with two of his students: Tanya Anisimova, a graduate of the Conservatory, now representing the United States, and young Byung Se Bong (South Korea), winner of the first prize at the Knushevitsky competition held in his birthplace, the town of Petrovsk. One may say that Knushevitsky's traditions are not only being passed down to new generations but are also being spread around the world.</p>
                 <p>The cellists chose to mark the jubilee with an unusual program where familiar pieces appeared under new angles. Like, for example, Jacques Offenbach, performed by a cello duet of I. Gavrysh and Byung Se Bong. Who could have thought that the king of operetta also wrote perfectly traditional classical music, much less for such an unconventional ensemble? Next in the program came the famous Brahms violin sonata No. 3 in D minor, transcribed for the cello and piano by Tanya Anisimova. According to her, this is part of a larger all-Brahms series, which will include recording three violin sonatas transcribed for the cello and two original cello sonatas.</p>
                 <p>Naturally, the cello version of the sonata brought something new into the musical representation of the work. Under the hands of Anisimova and her partner, pianist Lydia Frumkin (USA), the first movement took on a dark, foreboding character. The adagio brimmed with epic lyricism. The scherzo came out as a fantasy piece à la Schumann, and the finale provided the dramatic climax. Although somewhat foreign to the ears of fans of the original violin version, the new interpretation as played by the duo was convincing.</p>
                 <p>Tanya Anisimova is not only a performer but a composer; each of her return visits to her native soil is accompanied by a premiere of a new composition. This time Tanya and her teacher, I. Gavrysh, played an interesting piece for two cellos called Caravan. Anisimova is fascinated by Eastern cultures and Sufism, and the fabric of her piece contained echoes of Orientalism.</p>
                 <p>The concert ended with Rachmaninov's cello sonata performed by our American guests. As in their Brahms sonata, the quality of the ensemble deserves a special mention. Lydia Frumkin accompanied Tanya Anisimova with exceptional, painstaking delicacy, sometimes even restraining the full might of the piano in order to leave room for the soaring flight of the cello. And this unique evening was crowned by a still more extraordinary encore. Playing with Byung Se Bong, Tanya improvised an oriental composition where, in a climactic moment, she began to sing. Anisimova's multifaceted creativity cannot help but draw the listener in. And this is especially pleasant, given that she is essentially a "musical granddaughter" of Svyatoslav Knushevitsky, whose legacy -- as this concert showed -- is flourishing.</p>

                 Rogelio Macias Sanchez (Reviewer); Ruth Rose (Translator)

                 <p class="quote-open">This was a recital given by cellist Tanya Anisimova and pianist Lydia Frumkin.</p>
                 <p>Both are of Soviet birth and education, although they now live in the USA and are internationally renowned performers and teachers. Tanya is also a composer.</p>
                 <p>They opened their program with the Beethoven's Sonata Op. 69 for cello and piano that dates from 1807, being contemporary of "Fidelio" and the Fifth Symphony. The work is vigorous, sonorous, of a luminous optimism, and intensely romantic in its eagerness to belong to a new fraternal humanity. It is also a true manifesto of freedom and brotherhood. The interpretation was very "Russian", extremely vigorous, with no concession to tenderness, always aimed at heroism. It is an incredible force that distinguishes these performers, their way of interpreting Beethoven could not have been more wonderful or intense. There were people who missed some gentleness. Not me.</p>
                 <p>I go for the Promethean feeling of the Beethoven of that time, and that was the feeling of Tanya Anisimova and Lydia Frumkin. The applause of the audience was heartfelt.</p>
                 <p>The program closed with a piece by Tanya Anisimova composed this year, called Moscow-Mexico for cello and piano, in honor of her first teacher, who now lives in Mexico, teaches at the Conservatorio de las Rosas and attended the concert. This is an extraordinary piece, long, tonal, richly melodic, with a brilliant and complex harmonic texture, with stimulating rhythms that clearly recognize a Mediterranean, Andalusian or North African background, and of high virtuosic demands that Tanya Anisimova knew who she was entrusting to - herself. The final result was indescribably beautiful, and when Tanya asked her teacher to stand up to be honored by this dedication, she cried. She was not the only one.</p>
                 <p>But this art refuses to leave us. Tanya played an encore that ended up being one of the most remarkable musical moments I remember. She improvised with the solo cello and vocalized with it in a very refined melody, clearly Slavic-style, with such subtle harmonies that it took us from the Earth to stellar spaces, from which we returned with the emotional applause of the lucky ones who were present that night at the Conservatorio de las Rosas.</p>

                 <b class="title">"In" Series Annual Celebration of Female Artists</b>
                 The Washington Post, April 21, 2003<br/>
                 Joseph McLellan

                 <p class="quote-open">Tanya Anisimova spent most of the program alone onstage in Saturday afternoon's "In" Series concert -- alone with her cello, that is. But that was all the company she needed except in the first and last selections on the program, where she was joined in a smoothly expert partnership by pianist Carla Hubner, founder and artistic director of the series. The pieces with Hubner -- Schumann's imaginative Fantasy Pieces, Op. 73, and four selections from Falla's folk-flavored "Suite Populaire Espagnole" -- were the closest her program came to a traditional cello recital.</p>
                 <p>The performance, at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, was the first event of the "In" Series annual celebration of female artists. Most of the program was devoted to works for unaccompanied cello, including three of Anisimova's melodious, mystical and deeply emotional compositions. One work, Ezra Laderman's "A Single Voice," was composed for her and tailored to her style. A segment of Bach's Sonata No. 2 for unaccompanied violin was played in her transcription for cello. All were performed with a deep, supple, subtly expressive tone and an easy mastery of the instrument that seemed to recognize no technical problems.</p>
                 <p>To add to the impression of versatility, two of her compositions included wordless, powerfully evocative vocalises, which she sang with a pure, precisely controlled voice. This addition to the cello part may limit the possibility of performances by other cellists (I can't imagine Rostropovich or Yo-Yo Ma reaching the high notes that she tossed off with lyric grace), but it gave the music an added dimension and justified the concert's curious title, "Celle-StialMysticism."</p>
                 <p>Highlights of the program included Anisimova's "September 11," composed a few days after the terror attacks and capturing some of the mind-numbing horror of that event; her "Souvenir de St. Petersburg," reflecting on a visit to the Hermitage Museum; and Judith Shatin's "Sursum Corda" ("Lift up your hearts"), a dance piece that combines soaring melody with many technical challenges: glissando harmonics, simultaneous bowed and pizzicato notes, gruff declamation and sparkling arpeggios. Shatin was present to receive some well-deserved applause.</p>

                 John Campbell

                 <p class="quote-open">Picture a stage, bare except for a lithe female seated on a chair playing a cello and you will have an image of the experience of Tanya Anisimova playing Bach's Sonata No.1 in G Minor for solo violin, BWV 1001. Imagining the sound of the music is more difficult to conjure. Ms. Anisimova arranged this violin piece for cello. Creatively she has re- imagined this familiar piece as Bach might have written it had he all the resources of the contemporary cello. The concert at Chandler Hall, December 2, 2002 also featured Song on Mt. San Angelo, a solo piece written by Ms. Anisimova (b.1966) as part of a project while a resident at the Virginia Center for Creative Arts housed at Mt. San Angelo, an estate in Northern Virginia. Most impressive in this two-part composition, which makes extensive use of double stops, is the second section's somber, deeply moving beauty and richness with a second and third voice created on a solo instrument.</p>
                 <p>After intermission Ms. Anisimova returned to play a piece written for her by Ezra Laderman (b.1924) at Yale, Single Voice (1993). It is a highly structured improvisation and was performed by her with great freedom. As with much modern music, it is an assemblage of musical statements. With Ms. Anisimova playing it became a virtuosic showpiece.</p>

                 The Washington Post, March 31, 1999<br/>
                 L. Peat O'Neil

                 <p class="quote-open">Cellist Tanya Anisimova and pianist Jessica Krash performed an enticing program of Bach, Shostakovich and Messiaen, along with some of their own compositions, at the Hand Chapel on Sunday evening as part of the George Washington University "In" Series at Mount Vernon College.</p>
                 <p>Anisimova opened with "Song on Mount San Angelo," commemorating the landscape at the Virginia arts colony where she wrote it. The sonorous piece built from a simple atonal melody to a vigorous center that expressed the depth of a thoughtful soul. Native Washingtonian Krash joined Anisimova for the Sonata for Cello and Piano, written by Krash in 1991 and recently revised. The spare composition descends from works by French avant-garde composers such as Erik Satie, and features rapid phrases, bright punctuation, pauses and unresolved movement endings. The musicians played with compelling energy and the counter-rhythms in the third movement demanded intuitive timing by the duet.</p>
                 <p>Krash's postmodernist comment on the information age, "Details at 11," followed. She set out repeating sequences of staccato parts, interrupting the motifs then returning to them, suggesting the chaos of contemporary experience. Anisimova enthralled the audience with a virtuoso unraveling of J.S. Bach's Sarabande from Partita No. 2 and Prelude from Partita No. 3. For Dmitri Shostakovich's Sonata in D Minor, Op. 40, the women played as if they were one person, gracing technical precision with spiritual authority. After the emotional tumult of Shostakovich, a meditative prayer by French mystic Olivier Messiaen, "Louange a l'Eternite de Jesus," closed the program on a hopeful note.</p>
