                 <h5>Compositions</h5>
                 <b>Farela For Cello And Piano</b>
                 The title Farela stands for three musical pitches, F-D-A. It was conceived in 2015 as an encore piece for pianist Pi-Hsun Shih and myself. I had planned to compose a minimalistic, slightly whimsical bonbon to use for topping off our usually very intense programs. However, the project developed a will of its own resulting in a 15-minute-long virtuosic duet with equally dramatic piano and cello parts.The outer sections are lively, with subtle flamenco elements. The middle section is slower and more lyrical. Pitches F-D-A are sort of a leitmotif, which appears frequently throughout the piece, especially at its climatic points. Pi-Hsun Shih and the composer premiered the piece in November of 2015, in Promisek Concert Series in Bridgewater, Connecticut.</p>

                 <b>Icelandic Ballad For Cello And Piano</b>
                 The idea to write Icelandic Ballad for Cello and Piano came to me upon listening to the 14th century Icelandic hymn "Almighty G-d of All Lands" (Book of Lilja, c. 1340). The simple beauty of this chant, its self-contained structure, plus the component, which I would like to call "macro-ethnos" or "universal folk" quality - compelled me to create the Ballad. The theme is followed by ten variations. If one takes a closer look, one will be able to follow the history of western music, from the medieval to the future, unfolding through the piece. In October 2007, the composer and Prof. Lydia Frumkin gave the first performance of the work in Washington, D.C., to high critical acclaim. European premiere took place later that month at Salurinn Hall in Reykjavik.</p>

                 <b>Caravan For Two Cellos</b>
                 Our life is a journey. We are all caravan keepers. Will we have the strength and patience to bring our caravans safely to their destinations or will we loose our goods on the way?  I had wanted to write for two cellos as I was preparing for my 2007 concert in Moscow with my former Moscow Conservatory Cello Professor Igor Gavrysh. Paul Katz got interested in the piece while it was still in progress and we premiered its first version in Washington, D.C., in April ‘07. A month later, we gave the 1st performance of the current Caravan version at Rachmaninov Hall in Moscow, with Prof. Gavrysh.  Caravan since then has gained considerable popularity and is being performed by cellists worldwide. In 2011, Carrie Koffman arranged the work for two saxophones. Her arrangement of the piece was selected as The Favorite Composition at the 2012 Saxophone World Congress in UK. </p>

                 <b>Sufi Suite For Solo Cello</b>
                 "Where Shams-I Tabriz walks, the footprints become notations of music and the holes you fall through into space." Rumi (translated by Coleman Barks).  Sufi Suite was composed during summer of 2005 and was first performed in 2006, at Roerich Museum in New York City. Since its premiere, Sufi Suite has been played in Boston, Moscow, Mexico, and Australia. In 2007, it was included in Sufi Soul CD, which was described by Heather Kurzbauer in The Strad Magazine as "deep, exploratory and richly rewarding" and was featured on Amsterdam's Radio 4. Sufi Suite was inspired by Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī poetry. The first movement, After Rumi, is an arabesque-like prelude. The second movement, OM, is more substantial in size and combines vocal chanting (sang by the performer) and varied and intricate rhythms of a Sufi dance. The work asks for an alteration of the cello' tuning, i.e. scordatura: G-D-G-C which makes Sufi Suite pair well with J.S. Bach's Cello Suite in C Minor.</p>

                 <b>September 11 For Solo Cello</b>
                 September 11 for solo cello  came to me soon after the horrible events in September of 2001. The work is in a form of a chaconne. The world premiere took place during my solo recital in October of 2001, at The National Hebrew Congregation, in Washington, D.C. and it was featured on my 2002 Concert in Moscow CD. While preparing for a concert last year, I decided to revise the work. The present version is slightly longer; the culmination is more developed. While this composition has a mournful aura, it is not a work of a desperate anguish, but rather a life-affirming one.There is an all-pervading light. The souls of the innocent are not lost, but remembered forever with love.</p>

                 <b>Homage To Janos Starker</b>
                 Janos Starker became a hero of mine immediately after I heard his Kodaly Sonata Op.8. I come from a tradition of a chocolate velvety Russian cello tone, with an obligatory use of vibrato, heavy volumes of sound, which may result in a less elegant and/or sophisticated color palette. Upon listening to Mr. Starker, it dawned on me that one might be exceptionally expressive while using a lean and small sound. Later, listening to The Richard Strauss' Last Four Songs sang by Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, I had a very similar sensation. When I learned of Starker's passing, the first phrase of the present piece immediately popped up in my mind. The rest of the work came to me very easily. I might say the piece literally composed itself. Later, after its premiere in July of 2013 at Buckley Moss Museum, in Virginia, I came to realize that somehow Starker's Jewish-Russian roots and his early life in Hungary, as well as his virtuosity - had found their way into this work.</p>

                 <b>Homage To Sviatoslav Knushevitsky</b>
                 <p>In 2012, The First International Sviatoslav Knushevitsky Cello Competition commissioned a cello solo composition to be used as an obligatory solo during competition's second round. Homage to Sviatoslav Knushevitsky features some technically challenging material while employing melodies reminiscent of the Russian folk tunes. I studied cello at The Moscow Conservatory with Knushevitsky's former student, Igor Gavrysh.</p>

                 <b>Cynthia For Flute and Cello</b>
                 Cynthia for flute and cello was inspired and written for my friend Ms. Cynthia Tremblay, an accomplished flute player and improviser. Between 2002 and 2013, Cynthia and I had enjoyed many hours of improvising together, discussing life, art, food, and human nature. I think this miniature piece reflects the joy and deep connection I feel when I think of Cynthia.  Cynthia and I performed this piece for the first time at a friend's home in Virginia, in the summer of 2004.</p>

                 <b>TEACHER - Cello Nonet</b>
                 In the summer of 2017, I was preparing to go to Mexico City for a concert celebration of the 80th Birthday of my first cello teacher Zoia Kamysheva. An idea came to compose a cello ensemble piece to make this celebration more memorable. I was delighted to learn that Maestra Zoia's students in Mexico were willing to participate in the project. TEACHER's premiere took place at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México on August 27, 2017.  Cello Nonet "TEACHER" is dedicated to Zoia Kamysheva and it is an attempt to express my perception of her as a brilliant teacher and a surrogate mother.  The work is written in a free form, featuring some polyphonic writing and syncopated rhythms. Russian folk song "The Red Robe" is appearing at the golden section of the composition. In Russian folk tradition, the bride wore red robe during her wedding ceremony. Zoia Kamysheva made me learn this song shortly after I began my studies with her. Its melody has been etched in my memory ever since. Two happy years of my lessons with Zoia Nikolaevna ended abruptly with her leaving USSR for good to follow her Mexican husband while I was admitted to the Moscow Central Music School.</p>

                 <b>ADONAI For Solo Cello And String Orchestra</b>
                 The Lord says to my Adonai: "Sit at my right hand until I make all your enemies a footstool for your feet."  Dedicated to my Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory Cello Professor Igor Gavrysh, this work is a contemplation on the idea of the divine origin of the human soul. ADONAI received its world premiere performance in 2006 in the Moscow Conservatory Hall and performed by members of The Russian Chamber Orchestra conducted by Igor Lerman with the composer as cello soloist.</p>

                 <b>JS Bach, Chaconne (arr. Anisimova)</b>
                 The Bach Chaconne had been haunting me ever since I first heard it back in Moscow performed by my violinist friend. In 1994, I got some satisfaction out of performing it as a part of The Yale Cellos. However, the dream of going it alone, holding all the reins, remained. That is how my transcribing and recording of the Complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas For Solo Violin had begun. In 1995, while a fellow artist at The Virginia Center For The Creative Arts, I made the first attempt in recording the Chaconne. It was included in my "Music From Mt. San Angelo" CD, released by VCCA later that year. As it turns out, that was the first ever recording of the piece on the cello. In 2001, my 2CDs album with the Complete Sonatas and Partitas came out. There is also the 2012 video recording of the Chaconne made by The Blue House Productions. I have been using the violin sheet music (a copy of Bach's manuscript) to practice the piece. However, due to the growing demand for my arrangement, I have decided to make available this sheet music with some bowing and fingering suggestions. When I arrange a piece of music for the cello, I never seek to compete with an instrument that this piece was originally created for. I believe the cello to be an instrument that makes everything sound deeper, more meaningful and somehow more "human" than other instruments. This may have to do with the cello's range, which is close to the human voice as well as with the characteristics of the cello sound. I hope you will enjoy playing my arrangement of one of the most moving, intriguing and perfect pieces ever written. Happy practicing!</p>


                 <b>Marin Marais/Gendron, La Folia (arr. Anisimova)</b>
                 La Folia is an ancient Portuguese theme, which was danced to during Carnival processions since as early as 1400s.  As a child, I played the Moffat's version of La Folia. The present copy is a mix of my favorite variations by Marin Marais, Maurice Gendron, and my own. La Folia theme is very conducive to improvising. The player is encouraged to add his/her own takes on this inexhaustible subject.</p>
                 <b>Isaac Albeniz - Leyenda (arr. Anisimova For Solo Cello)</b>
                 It is with great pleasure that I am presenting my version of the famed Leyenda from Asturias by Isaac Albeniz. I think maestro Albeniz would have been surprised to see it, not only because this arrangement is in itself a daring act, but also because it tends to follow the composer's original piano version of the piece more closely than a more famous guitar transcription. I have been haunted by this piece for many years. I find the austere yet deeply passionate nature of this music absolutely irresistible. As it is with any good music, there are multiple ways to interpret Leyenda. There are a few optional bowings offered in this edition. It is implied that if one decides to play this piece, one is capable of making their own decision on whether to follow a toccata-like or a more lyrical approach while interpreting this chef d'oeuvre.</p>
