      "instructions": "<p>The technique of stretching is one of the great challenges faced by progressing beginner cellists, and must be approached with care and precision. In spite of this it is often neglected or glossed over as a technique, and becomes a real sticking point in left hand technique. When stretch position is not properly studied or understood it causes intonation issues, tension in the left hand and forearm, and is always noticeable to the listener as a technical flaw.</p><p>To understand how the stretch works, let’s examine the familiar closed position. Your fingers are placed an equal distance apart and the interval between each is a semitone. The interval from first to fourth finger (on the same string) is therefore a minor third.</p><p><img src='images/closed-position.jpg' alt='Closed Position'/><br/><img src='images/minor-third.jpg' alt='Closed Position - Minor Third'/></p><p>In the closed position we do not have access to the semitones between the open string and first finger; or the fourth finger and the next open string. We reach these by extending backwards or forwards. When in stretch position we also extend the interval between the first and fourth fingers to a major third without having to shift the entire hand forwards or backwards.</p><p>As shown in the image below, a backward stretch means that the first finger extends towards the topnut by a semitone while the second, third and fourth fingers remain in place. This means that there is a whole tone between the first and second fingers and semitones between second, third and fourth fingers.</p><p><img src='images/stretch-position-backwards.jpg' alt='Backwards Stretch Position'/><br/><img src='images/major-third.jpg' alt='Backwards Stretch Position - Major Third'/></p><p>In a forward stretch position, the only finger to remain in place from the original closed position is the first. The second finger extends forwards towards the bridge by a semitone, pushing the second third and fourth fingers forward by a semitone each.</p><p><img src='images/stretch-position-forwards.jpg' alt='Stretch Position Forwards'/><br/><img src='images/major-third-2.jpg' alt='Stretch Position Forwards - Major Third'/></p><p>So the only difference between the backward and forward stretch positions is the notes under the hand. The physical position for the fingers and hand is identical. A common mistake among cello students is to extend the fourth finger away from the third to achieve the forward stretch. This should be avoided at all costs – especially for those with smaller hands. The hand simply isn’t built to accommodate a whole tone stretch between the third and fourth fingers for any length of time, especially when playing across two strings or playing in keys that require frequent and prolonged stretches.</p><p>It takes time and regular practice to become comfortable with stretch position, but there are a few tips that will greatly facilitate the learning process:</p><ol><li>Allowing the first (and largest) knuckle of the index finger to collapse will facilitate the stretch between the first and second fingers.</li><li>Allow the thumb to move slightly down the neck (in the opposite direction to the first finger) or let it leave the neck altogether.</li><li>Avoid pressure from the thumb at all costs. Smaller hands may find it necessary to release the thumb from the neck altogether – if this facilitates the stretch better, always remember to bring the thumb back to the neck when returning to closed position. To maintain overall stability it is best to have the thumb making gentle contact with the neck at all times.</li><li>Allow the elbow to move slightly down and forwards, and keep the shoulder completely relaxed and mobile.</li><li>Remember that the stretch is always between the first and second fingers.</li><li>Familiarise yourself with and ideally memorise the notes belonging to forward and backward stretches on each string.</li><li>It is best not to attempt stretching in other positions until you have mastered it in first.</li></ul>"

      "instructions": "<p>Sufi Suite was inspired by Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī poetry.  The work asks for an alteration of the cello’ tuning, i.e. scordatura: G-D-G-C.</p><p>This piece will require performing quick response and a big open sound right up to the highest register of each string. Practice will ensure you become more secure in the higher positions, reducing the chance of poor intonation and inferior tone production. </p><p>If you encounter difficultly playing this piece, I recommend good daily practice of scales and arpeggios. use a metronome and remember it is impossible to practise too slowly whereas practising too fast is not only possible, it’s disastrous.</p>"
